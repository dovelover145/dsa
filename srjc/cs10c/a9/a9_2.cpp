This program simulates a bank. It contains the function simulate, which reads input from a file containing arrival times and transaction times and simulates the time it will take for all of the customers to come and go, giving a final average waiting time for a customer at the bank. The functions processArrival and processDeparture process customers arriving and departing from the bank, respectively, and are helper functions for simulate.
